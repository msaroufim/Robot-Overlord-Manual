# Robot Overlord Manual
If you're here, I'm assuming you'd like to one day control your own robot army. Ethical implications aside, it's hard to build a robot army. You have quite a bit to learn from how to simulate robots, how to program them, how to build them physically

One common place to start is Andrew Ng's Machine Learning class. But here you were all excited to learn about how to build robots only to be learning how to predict rental prices in San Francisco. Don't get me wrong, supervised learning is cool and all but it doesn't give you the same wow factor as when you saw AlphaGo crush Lee Sedol or when you see that Boston dynamics video of a robot backflipping and it's that wow factor that I want to tap into for this book.

## What is this book about?
The scope of the book is quite wide but for some reason most of the below topics aren't covered in the standard introductory ML books. This sucked for me because I had to piece stuff together from open source codebases, papers and textbooks. Hopefully my effort will save you a bunch of effort and encourage you to explore some of these topics in more depth.

* ML language design
    * [What's a good programming language for robots and ML?](book/1-ML-language.md)
    * [What's a good API for ML?](book/2-Keras.md)
    * How to deploy ML models?
    * Differentiable Computing
* How to design AI to play board games
    * How to program board games
    * Dynamic programming
    * Reinforcement Learning
    * Monte Carlo Tree Search
    * Putting everything together
* How to design AI to play video games
    * Deep Q learning
    * How to create your own Open AI gym
    * Recurrent Neural networks for memory
    * Model based vs model free methods
    * Hidden information vs perfect information games
    * Interpretability
* How to program robots in software
    * Programming reward functions
    * Differentiable physics engine
    * Programming a 2D robot arm
    * Programming a 3d robot arm
    * Programming animal location
        * Slithering
        * Crawling
        * Gliding
    * Programming a humanoid

## I prefer reading on paper, is there a physicaly copy I can buy?
I'm planning on releasing a physical copy later this year, stay tuned!

## Could you talk about X?
I'm happy to write about topics you find interesting. Just open up a Github issue and I'll address it ASAP.
